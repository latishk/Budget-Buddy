The project is renamed from intuit-hackathon to Budget-Buddy.
The current app is based on the idea that we regularly plan to eat with our friends and roommates who have different budgets. 
Deciding which restarant to eat at becomes a task in which we have to look through menus to see the price. Here we want to budget plan our
meal so we made a rest api using node.js for backend and express.js for middleware to show our concept of the app. One can add budget for 
friends and based on that our backend calculates the average budget which later is used to get restaurants from zomato api, we are using zomato.
since yelp doesn't provide price ranges. Later to show our backend working we have built a single page in html and javascript which uses google map api and any charts to show the places on the map and price bar graph of the places so that it is easy to decide. To run the app.
